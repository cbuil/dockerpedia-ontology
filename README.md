Dockerpedia Ontology
===================

The purpose of the DockerPedia ontology is to represent software images. The ontology is a simple vocabulary with  prefix docker. The ontology main classes are `docker:Dockerfile`, which is used to build a `docker:SoftwareImage`, which itself is decomposed in `docker:ImageLayers`. Since we aim to track the particular versions of all packages installed in an image, we distinguish the concept `docker:SoftwarePackage` and its respective `docker:PackageVersions`.
We also include the representation of `docker:SoftwareVulnerabilities`, which are crucial to create alerts when comparing or reusing software images. 

We reuse and extend existing ontologies whenever possible. We build on the [Workflow Infrastructure Conservation Using Semantics ontology](http://vocab.linkeddata.es/wicus/wicus/) (WICUS with prefix `wicus`) [12], an OWL ontology network that represents the main concepts of a computational infrastructure. WICUS contains terminology for describing computational scientific experiments, including their software, hardware and computing resources; and we align our terminology to existing classes and properties. A `docker:Dockerfile` is defined as subclass of the more generic `wicus:DeploymentScript`, as each Docker file contains the set of actionable steps to be carried out during the deployment of the container.
